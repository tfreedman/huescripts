Fun scripts for controlling Phillips Hue lights


##VLC.py
VLC.py will turn all of your lights off when you full screen VLC, and turn them back on again when either the movie finishes, you take VLC out of full screen mode, or you quit VLC.

To use it, you'll need to add your bridge's IP address where it says YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE. You'll also need to find and replace 2560 and 1440, if your monitor has a different horizontal or vertical resolution.

Support for other programs shouldn't be difficult to add, but for now only VLC is supported.

Requires OS X and phue for python.
